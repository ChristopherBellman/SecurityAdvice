BITAG recommends that IoT device manufacturers secure communications using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) [96,97,98]. Some devices can perform symmetric key encryption in near-real time. In addition, Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) provides additional options for securing traffic to and from resourceconstrained devices. If devices rely on a public key infrastructure (PKI), then an authorized entity must be able to revoke certificates when they become compromised, as web browsers and PC operating systems do [99,100,101,102,103,104,105]. Cloud services can strengthen the integrity of certificates issued by certificate authorities through, for example, participating in Certificate Transparency [106]. Finally, manufacturers should take care to avoid encryption methods, protocols, and key sizes with known weaknesses. \n\nVendors who rely on cloud-hosted support for IoT devices should configure their servers to follow best practices, such as configuring the TLS implementation to only accept the latest TLS protocol versions.",

Responsible disclosure requires the researcher to first notify the manufacturer or governing authorities and allow reasonable time for the vulnerability to be independently verified and fixed before going public with a system hack.

For such reasons, strategic threats require strategic mitigation technologies. Security analytics can leverage security telemetry from devices and network hardware to help provide an understanding of what is happening in the environment, including detection of stealthier threats. \n\nEqually importantly, “monitoring” and analytics can often be deployed as an interim solution in environments where upgrading devices to conform to the first three cornerstones above will take years. Examples of such environments include legacy devices such as industrial control systems (manufacturing, oil and gas, utilities) that cannot be modified until an end-to-end replacement system is ready, automotive cars already on the road whose deeply embedded microcontrollers obviously cannot be “torn out and replaced,” and healthcare environments where suppliers prohibit hospitals from modifying the equipment to add security. In such cases, anomaly detection solutions can be extremely valuable. The deterministic nature of many IoT networks allows the system to be baselined and deviations quickly identified. The wide variety of industrial and IoT protocols can make the problem harder, but newer techniques using advanced machine learning can allow the problem to be solved. Considering that many IoT systems have high demands on availability, this solution is less invasive in “detect” mode while ensuring that any false positives do not bring down the system.",

In other words, the first step in protecting a device is to protect the code to be sure the device only boots and runs code that you want it running. Fortunately, many chipmakers already build “secure boot” capabilities into their chips. Similarly, for “higher level” code, a number of time-proven, opensource, and client-side libraries like OpenSSL can easily be used to check signatures of code, and accept code only if it comes from an authorized source. In that context, signing firmware, boot images, and higherlevel embedded code are all increasingly common, including signing the underlying software components such as any operating system, and not just applications, but all code on the device. This approach can ensure that all critical components, sensors, actuators, controllers, and relays are all properly configured to only run signed code and never run unsigned code.",

It is assumed that devices and other components of a WoT system (gateways, for example) start the operational phase in a secure state. WoT best practices are focused on keeping devices and services in a secure state staring from this assumption. However, to enter operational state in secure fashion, additional best practices need to be followed during manufacturing, deployment and provisioning, and best practices should also be followed for secure update.\n\nGood references for best practices for secure update and provisioning are the IIC Security Framework [IICSF] and the IoT Security Foundation's guidelines [IoTSF].",

From these objectives, the applicable security policies are selected based on the industry vertical, customer base, geographic location and other considerations. The security policy describes the overall business-risk considerations and defines the guidelines for securing the day-to-day proper functioning of the system.

These entities, however, act as gates allowing data to pass in and out of the ecosystems these entities are connected to.\n\nFor example, a particular SIM card may be provisioned for use in an industrial control system such as an oil well monitoring device. A SIM card, by design, is a removable component. Anyone with physical access to the oil well monitoring device can extract the SIM card and place it in a laptop. If the laptop has software on it that can simulate the functionality of the oil device, the back-end server will be unable to differentiate between the actual oil device and the laptop. Yet, the laptop will be authenticated to the Cellular network because of the SIM card! Thus, the Cellular network has authenticated the SIM card, but not the laptop.",
